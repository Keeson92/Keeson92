- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Keeson92
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in finances, IT, poetry, knitting, camping with caravan and lots more 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Objectoriented systemdevelopment as well as Financial Management
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I thought I was half swedish, 1/4 english and 1/4 scottish.. turns out my DNA heritage is wider and more complex than I first thought ðŸ˜†
  45% Swedish, 28% English, 14% Scottish, 8% Norwegian, 3% Finnish, 2% Baltic.
 My initial thought was that the Norwegian part must come from my Swedish father,
 but it turns out it comes from my british mother,
 so my thought about that must be from the Vikings who came to Great Britain.
